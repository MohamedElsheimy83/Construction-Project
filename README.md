# Construction-Project

## CONTEXT  

We need to represent workers, who have a tool box and who are assigned to a specific construction site.   

We will therefore have the following objects: Worker, Tool, Profession, Site, Status (5 classes).  

In this application, many object oriented programming are applied.
